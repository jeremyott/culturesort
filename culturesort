Create a swipeable personality test that uses the Traitify API to identify
you personality traits.
I will be using the swing library to create the swipe functionality.
Once Traitify has successfully identified your personality trait
store that information and request jobs from Indeed that correspond with
the stored personality. Return jobs in batches 3.

//APIs
Indeed: http://www.indeed.com/jsp/apiinfo.jsp
Traitify: https://app.traitify.com/developer

//Libraries
https://github.com/alkawryk/tinderjs
https://github.com/gajus/swing
https://jqueryui.com/

//DB
https://firebase.google.com/

If time allows for it, provide filter options for city, salary, etc.
